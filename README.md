Hi AIW <br>
You have given me to create e-commerce shopping app using react.<br>
According to the description i created react application in which.<br>
1.There is a navbar with HOME button and.<br>
2.Also below the nav having Search bar for filtering the product.<br>
3.And along with Search bar there is Cart navigation where we can see our Cart Item.<br>
4.Another task which was giving that detail page of individual product on in this I try to <br>
do but the lack of time I can't perform task properly but everything is perfect according to the task.<br>
5.Also when click on plus and minus the product will add and sub from the cart which work fine.<br>
6.After adding product cart will show the total ammount where we can Confirm Order.<br>
